#README

This is a personal project to review/deepen understanding of React.js with the Redux pattern. It utilizes 3 API's (Seatgeek, Yelp, and Google Maps) to help a user plan their evening. Note: seatgeek API does not have much data for non-major US cities--I'll be looking to correct this with perhaps another API to account for that.
